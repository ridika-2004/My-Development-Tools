# PONG Game

Welcome to **PONG**, a classic retro-style arcade game recreated in C++ with the powerful **Raylib** library! 🕹️

## 📝 Description
This is a two-player PONG game with basic physics and smooth animations. Players use paddles to hit the ball back and forth, and the first to miss loses the round. Simple yet fun!

## 🎮 How to Play
- Player 1: Computer CPU 
- Player 2: Use `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` to move the right paddle.
- Keep the ball in play and challenge your reflexes!

- **g++** (C++ compiler)
- **Raylib** library

   ```
